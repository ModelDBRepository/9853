Effects of cellular geometry on current flow during a propagated action potential.
Biophys. J. 31: 183-194

This model qualitatively reproduces figures 2,3,4,5 and,
to a lesser extent, fig 7.
It is entirely possible that I misinterpreted  the meaning of figure 7 as
a plot of separately integrated positive and negative total membrane current.
Such a plot shows much less "charge transfer" in the proximal region of
the wire than is shown in the paper figure.
I attribute other discrepancies to the precise recording locations and the
details of spatial discretization.

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to him
at michael.hines@yale.edu.
